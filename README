Redis Sampler README
====================

Redis sampler is an utility to check the composition of your Redis dataset.

Using it is as simple as typing:

    ./redis-sampler.rb <host> <port> <db> <samplesize>

The host and port argument are the ones of your Redis instance.
The DB is the database to test. By default Redis uses database 0 unless you
are writing against a different DB.

The sample size is the number of elements to check using RANDOMKEY.
For large datasets a sample size of 100000 or more is recommended.
