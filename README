Redis Sampler README
====================

Redis sampler is an utility to check the composition of your Redis dataset.

Using it is as simple as typing:

    ./redis-sampler.rb <host> <port> <db> <samplesize>

The host and port arguments are the ones of your Redis instance.
The DB is the database to test. By default Redis uses database 0 unless you
are writing against a different DB.

The sample size is the number of elements to check using RANDOMKEY.
For large datasets a sample size of 100000 or more is recommended.

To understand how the program works you can try a few runs setting the
sampling size to just 1000, for fast execution.

It is highly recommended to run the program via loopback interface or fast
LAN, otherwise the execution time will be pretty high.

Example Output
==============

Sampling localhost:6379 DB:4 with 100000 RANDOMKEYS
